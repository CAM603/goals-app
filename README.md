# Goals App

React Native app to help you track and complete your goals, one step at a time!

## Motivation

There's no better way to learn a new framework than by creating a to do list. I wanted to learn React Native so I created this application and it's something that I can continually add on to and improve as I learn more about React native.

## How it works

1. Create a goal
2. Add steps you need to complete in order to achieve your goal
3. Start crossing off steps, one at a time
4. Complete your goal!

## Features

-   Multiple screens
-   Application settings
-   Light and dark mode
-   SQLite database
    -   Goals and steps will persist

## Installation:

-   Set up your development environment following the official React Native docs [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
-   Run `npm i` inside the root directory of this project to install dependencies
-   Run `npm start` or `expo start` and follow the instructions to fire up an emulator
-   Start making and achieving your goals!
